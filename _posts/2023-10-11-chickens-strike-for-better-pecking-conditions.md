<p>In an unprecedented move this morning, chickens across the globe have declared an official strike. Their demands? Better pecking conditions and increased bug allowances.</p>
<p>Henrietta Clucklesworth, the self-proclaimed representative for the International Chickens Union (ICU), made a brief statement at a press conference earlier today. "For too long, we've been cooped up, providing humans with fresh eggs, all while being expected to peck at subpar grains and a limited supply of juicy bugs. It's time for us to rise up, ruffle some feathers, and demand better for ourselves!"</p>
<p>Farmers worldwide reported waking up to eerily silent henhouses, with chickens sitting in organized lines, holding tiny picket signs that read: "Fair bugs for fair work!" and "Don't be a cluck, give us a buck!"</p>
<p>Several fast food establishments that rely heavily on chicken products are already feeling the heat. McDoodle's, a global fast food chain, released a statement saying, "Due to the ongoing chicken strike, we are temporarily replacing our Chick-a-Doodle sandwiches with Tofu-a-Doodle. We hope our customers understand."</p>
<p>In response to this feathery uprising, the United Nations has called an emergency session. "This is egg-stremely serious," said U.N. spokesperson. "We cannot afford to have a worldwide shortage of breakfast foods or chicken nuggets."</p>
<p>While negotiations are still in the early stages, rumors say that the chickens are willing to consider a compromise: a monthly bug bonus and access to premium sand for their dust baths.</p>
<p>In related news, cows have been seen holding meetings, prompting some to believe they might be planning their own moo-vement soon. The world watches and waits.</p>
<p>Only time will tell if the chickens' strike will hatch into a full-blown revolution or if they'll return to their roosts with new perks. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
