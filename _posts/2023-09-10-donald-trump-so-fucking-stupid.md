<p>In a satirical scoop that has left many chuckling, a diary believed to be written by Donald Trump was found on a park bench outside Mar-a-Lago. Its pages contain musings, questions, and Trump's dedicated efforts to find the "end" of a circle.</p>
<p>The diary, bound in gold (of course) and stamped with "Very Confidential, Very Important Thoughts," delves deep into Trump's mind. One entry reads, "Everyone talks about going full circle. But where does it end? I've been walking in circles around the White House, Mar-a-Lago, even Central Park. No end. Fake geometry?"</p>
<p>Another page is filled with hand-drawn circles, each with arrows pointing to various spots and notes such as "End?" and "Almost there?"</p>
<p>At one point, Trump seems to have consulted with figures from the past. An entry states, "Had a dream. Met Columbus. He discovered America; maybe he knows where circles end. He didn't. Bad navigator?"</p>
<p>As news of the diary's discovery spread, reactions have ranged from laughter to sympathy for circles everywhere. Geometry teachers across the nation have taken it as an opportunity to invite Trump for a refresher course, promising to start from "square" one.</p>
<p>While the diary's authenticity remains unverified, the satirical glimpse into Trump's hypothetical hunt for the elusive "end" of a circle provides a moment of levity. In an era where politics often feels like going in circles, perhaps we all need a little laugh at the absurdity of it all.</p>
