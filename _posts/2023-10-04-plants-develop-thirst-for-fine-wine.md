<p>In an uncorked turn of events, botanists across the world are reporting that various plant species have developed a sudden and unquenchable thirst for merlot. Garden parties have taken a dramatic turn, with hosts discovering their prized tulips dipping into guests' wine glasses.</p>
<p>Dr. Vincent Grapevine, a renowned botanist, commented on the phenomenon during an emergency broadcast on the Botanical Network. "It appears that a genetic mutation, likely due to recent cosmic radiation waves, has caused plants to crave the rich, tannin-filled flavors of merlot. They no longer want water. Just wine."</p>
<p>The world's wine industry has been thrown into turmoil. Prices for merlot have surged, with vineyards struggling to keep up with the unprecedented demand from both flora and fauna. Bars and restaurants are replacing tap water with merlot in a bid to keep their indoor plants satiated.</p>
<p>In the financial district, traders who once sought solace in a glass of wine after a long day on the trading floor are now competing with their office ficuses for the last drop.</p>
<p>On the romantic front, candlelit dinners have been thrown into disarray. One gentleman recounted his recent date night, "I reached for the wine to pour a glass for my date, only to find her bouquet of roses had guzzled it all down!"</p>
<p>However, it's not all sour grapes. The houseplant industry is booming, with millennials particularly keen to own the latest "wine connoisseur cactus" or "merlot-loving monstera."</p>
<p>Leading sommelier, Clara Corkscrew, is offering classes to help plant enthusiasts identify their fern's preferred vintage. "It's essential to understand whether your daffodil prefers a full-bodied Bordeaux or a lighter Californian blend," she advises.</p>
<p>While many are adapting to this new reality, the long-term implications remain unclear. Will vineyards expand their operations, or will new hybrid wines be developed exclusively for plants?</p>
<p>Only time will tell. Until then, if you find your gardenias sneaking a sip from your glass, perhaps it's time to switch to a chardonnay. Stay tuned for more updates on this intoxicating tale!</p>
