<p>Downtown's swanky lounge, "Noir Nights," became the epicenter of a baffling phenomenon last evening. What was marketed as an upscale speed dating event took a poetic twist when attendees began exclusively conversing in haikus.</p>
<p>Sarah, a 28-year-old lawyer recounted her experience:<br>
"Asked him about work,<br>
He replied about the rain,<br>
Five-seven-five, strange."</p>
<p>Event organizer, Max, was as perplexed as the participants. "We thought it'd be a night of flirtatious glances and getting-to-know-you chats. But then...haikus."</p>
<p>While some attendees embraced the rhythmic challenge:<br>
"Love in short verses,<br>
Whispers in the dim-lit room,<br>
Heartbeats sync in rhyme."</p>
<p>Others found it less than ideal:<br>
"Wanted to discuss,<br>
Shared Netflix tastes and travel,<br>
Got poems, left confused."</p>
<p>Whether it was an unforeseen glitch in the matrix or just a curious case of collective poetic inspiration, "Noir Nights" will undoubtedly go down in speed dating lore. And who knows? Some might just find love in the syllabic confines of a haiku.</p>
