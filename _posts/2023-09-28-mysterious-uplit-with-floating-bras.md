<p>The intimate town of Laceyville was all abuzz this weekend when "Satin & Lace," the local lingerie boutique, reported an unexpected phenomenon: bras mysteriously levitating off their racks.</p>
<p>Ella Delicate, the shop owner, remarked, "I thought I'd had a bit too much bubbly at lunch when I first saw the bras floating around. But then, Mrs. Thompson walked in and got hit in the face with a flying balconette!"</p>
<p>Several customers found the experience quite titillating, with one gentleman stating, "I was just here to buy a gift for my wife's birthday, but this... this is quite the show!"</p>
<p>However, not everyone was amused. One displeased customer complained, "I just wanted a simple strapless for the evening, not a paranormal experience!"</p>
<p>Local paranormal investigator, Ivan Etheral, believes it's the spirits of fashionistas past making a statement. "They're probably just upset about the current trends. I've always said the fashion world was haunted."</p>
<p>In light of the events, "Satin & Lace" is considering rebranding to a more immersive shopping experience, tentatively named "The Levitating Lingerie Lounge."</p>
<p>Whether it's a ghostly grievance or just a gust of wind, the spectacle has certainly given Laceyville's residents a lift and a reason to chuckle. If you're in the market for some ethereal intimates, you know where to go!</p>
