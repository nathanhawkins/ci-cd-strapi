<p>In a dazzling turn of events, unicorns, long believed to be creatures of myth and legend, have been spotted across various cities around the globe. And while many are enchanted by their ethereal beauty, there's a more pressing concern unfolding: a worldwide shortage of glitter.</p>
<p>Reports began flooding in last week from places like Paris, Tokyo, and New York, where unicorns were seen prancing around major landmarks. Notably, the Eiffel Tower was briefly turned into a massive sparkly beacon, thanks to a particular unicorn's fondness for rubbing against it.</p>
<p>Lola Sparkletoes, CEO of Glitz & Glam, the world's leading glitter manufacturer, voiced her concerns during a press conference yesterday. "Our glitter reserves are running dangerously low. These unicorns have a natural affinity for all things sparkly, and they've been consuming our stock at an alarming rate."</p>
<p>The glitter shortage has led to pandemonium in various sectors. The arts and crafts community is in an uproar, and kindergarten teachers are reportedly on the verge of a meltdown.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, celebrities are feeling the pinch too. "I was set to release my new fashion line next week, and now there's no glitter for my launch party," lamented a famous pop star, who wished to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>On the flip side, vacuum cleaner sales have skyrocketed. "It's the unicorn aftermath," said Bob Hoover, a leading vacuum salesperson. "Glitter everywhere! People are desperate to clean it up."</p>
<p>While many are grappling with the glitter crisis, environmentalists are celebrating the unicorn's natural ability to decompose plastic. It seems their love for glitter isn't just about the sparkle â€“ they're digesting and transforming it into harmless rainbow droplets.</p>
<p>The World Council of Magical Creatures (WCMC) is slated to hold a meeting with the unicorn representatives to strike a balance between their glitter consumption and the world's glitter production.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, children worldwide are just thrilled to have their fairy tales come alive, blissfully unaware of the sparkling chaos unfolding.</p>
<p>In a related story, leprechauns have issued a statement advising people to stay away from their pots of gold at the end of rainbows, fearing unicorns might mistake them for giant glitter pots.</p>
